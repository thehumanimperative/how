< HOW IS THI ? >

THI is good. It is the best. THI is also difficult. It is the hardest. THI depends on effective communication across all media.

I am making up the ‘how’ as I go. I am certain that many more great minds will step forth and initialize many an awesome idea toward the ‘how’ question. 

But never fear, I don’t, ’How’ is what makes THI fun. ‘How’ is always the tricky part. ‘How’ will compel any body working on this project to work with others, for the tasks are all in epic proportion. A single mind is incapable—by definition—of hosting an project of epic proportion.
